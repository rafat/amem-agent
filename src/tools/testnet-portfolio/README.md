# Testnet Portfolio Tools

This directory contains tools for tracking portfolio positions across all testnet protocols.

## Available Functions

- `getTestnetPortfolio` - Get a user's complete portfolio across all protocols

## Contract Reference

The tools interact with the PortfolioTracker.sol contract located in `src/contracts/PortfolioTracker.sol`.

## Note

The current implementations use placeholder contract addresses and ABIs. These will need to be updated with the actual deployed contract addresses and ABIs when they become available.
