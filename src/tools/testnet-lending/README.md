# Testnet Lending Tools

This directory contains tools for interacting with the testnet LendingPool contract.

## Available Functions

- `depositCollateral` - Deposit collateral tokens
- `borrowTokens` - Borrow tokens using deposited collateral
- `repayBorrowedTokens` - Repay borrowed tokens
- `withdrawCollateral` - Withdraw deposited collateral

## Contract Reference

The tools interact with the LendingPool.sol contract located in `src/contracts/LendingPool.sol`.

## Note

The current implementations use placeholder contract addresses and ABIs. These will need to be updated with the actual deployed contract addresses and ABIs when they become available.
