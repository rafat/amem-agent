# Testnet Staking Tools

This directory contains tools for interacting with the testnet Staking contract.

## Available Functions

- `stakeTokens` - Stake tokens in the staking pool
- `unstakeTokens` - Unstake tokens from the staking pool
- `claimStakingRewards` - Claim rewards from the staking pool

## Contract Reference

The tools interact with the Staking.sol contract located in `src/contracts/Staking.sol`.

## Note

The current implementations use placeholder contract addresses and ABIs. These will need to be updated with the actual deployed contract addresses and ABIs when they become available.
