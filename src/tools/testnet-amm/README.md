# Testnet AMM Tools

This directory contains tools for interacting with the testnet AMM contract.

## Available Functions

- `addAMMLiquidity` - Add liquidity to token pairs
- `removeLiquidity` - Remove liquidity from token pairs
- `swapTokens` - Swap tokens using the AMM

## Contract Reference

The tools interact with the AMM.sol contract located in `src/contracts/AMM.sol`.

## Note

The current implementations use placeholder contract addresses and ABIs. These will need to be updated with the actual deployed contract addresses and ABIs when they become available.
